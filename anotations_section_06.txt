    $(function(){...}) --> to start the JQuery section;
    $() --> It's used like a selector;
    Example: var item = $('.item); --> JQuery.

    $(document).ready(function(){...}) is the long form to start the JQuery section;
    $(function{...}) is the short form;
    .val() --> method used to return the value.

Video lesson 82.
    $('#card h1') --> that command line is taking the h1 of some DOM object that has a ID named by "card";
    $('...').html() --> JQuery method that works like the .innerHTML = "";
    $('...').attr() --> JQuery method that works like the method .setAttribute();
    OBS: When we will call a function inside of an event, we write just the function's name, it doesn't need of the parentheses.

    .addClass('') --> method used to add a class of an element;
    .removeClass('') --> method used to remove a class of an element;
    .toggleCLass('') --> varies between add and remove to every click;
    OBS: when you put !important on the side of a CSS line, the command will have preference.

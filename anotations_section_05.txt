    JavaScript:
        it's a language implemented natively and originally like a web browsers part for that the scripts could be executed in the client side and could interact without the necessity of this script pass through the server;
        the javscript allow us to control the DOM elements behavior: HMLT, XML and SVG, generating dynamic interactions by scripts to these events; 
        Dom(Document Object Model):
            all the things that we can interact with JS it's inside of the DOM;
            stores values, funcionalities, etc;
            by the DOM we can acess all the elements hierarchy of our page:
                we can acess the elements(fathers or sons), the tags, the values stores inside a div of our pages, etc;

        the JavaScript allows create interactions in a page;
        inside of all the browsers exist an JS interpreter;
        scripts --> JS code;

    Client side:
        How a web page is renderized:
            1. you acess a site by the link;
            2. the server will receive this requisition
            3. the server will understand what is the page that you're requiring;
            4. he will set up the document in the server;
            5. when he finishes the assembly he gives the document to the client side --> the browser;
                5.1 - OBS: the server gives a HTML to the browser;
            7. the first thing that the client side looks it's the HTML structure;
            8. the second thing that the client side looks it's the resources (medias);
            9. the third thing that the client side looks is the CSS;
            10. finally, the last thing that the client side looks is the JavaScript:
                10.1 - he will check if exists JavaScript in the page;
                10.2 - download the JavaScript file.
            11. After that the client side know all that information he will renderized the page.
        
        Why JavaScript is the last to be verified by the browser:
            because the JavaScript depends of the HTML and CSS for start to work;
            basicallly the HTML is a part of the DOM and the JS it's to interact with the DOM, so, if doesn't exist DOM the JS doesn't have nothing to interact;

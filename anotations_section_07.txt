    transform: scale(x,y) : 
        - scale(x,y) it's an 2D transform method that can increases or decreases the size of an ellement;
        - scale(x) --> represents the axis X of the element. The value varies between 0.0 and 1.0;
        - scale(y) --> represents the axis Y of the element. The value varies between 0.0 and 1.0;
        - example: scale(0,1) --> it's saying that the element will have 100%(1.0) of your Y(height) axis and 0%(0.0) of your X(width). 

    transform-origin: (axis Y) (axis X) : 
        - it's a property that sets the origin for an element's transformations;
        - example: transform-origin: center left --> it's saying that the element's transformation in the axis Y will stay in the center and in the axis X will grow up to the left.

Media Queries:
    It's a CSS's module that allows us to determine specifics styles of a HTML for determinated media. Also allows us to define a break or a starting point (breakpoint) for that a styles set can be aplicated to a HTML element.

How to use:
    @media only screen and (min-width: 554px) {
        .aleatory-class {

        }

    } --> The css gonna function when the width is bigger or equal to 554px. In this case, 554px is the breakpoint

    @media only screen and (min-width: 992px) {
        .aleatory-class {
            
        }
    }
